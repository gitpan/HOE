NAME
    HOE - Alternative kernel implementation of POE, for the heck of it.

SYNOPSIS
    Usually right when you would call

      use POE qw(stuff);

    insert another line just above it, like so

      use HOE;
      use POE qw(stuff);

    or just include on the command line.

      perl -MHOE thing.perl

    You can disable with an environment variable.

      HOE_DISABLE=1

DESCRIPTION
    Hello,

    First off a warning; What you read below is my idea of what should be.
    Please check the TODO file for what I know I need to implement and if
    you find any other edge let me know.

    HOE is an alternative Kernel implmentation for POE. It includes all the
    support classes that it uses for itself but for [PH]OE to be useful you
    also need sessions and wheels other creations. These all come from the
    main POE distribution and I depend on that package in this one.

    The goal in writing this collection of modules was to search for
    different possibly faster, possibly cleaner, possibly more elegant, or
    whatever alternatives for the POE classes. In some ways it is faster
    than POE, in some ways it's slower.

    Cheers
